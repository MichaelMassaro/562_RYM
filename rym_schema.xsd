                unique identifier. This is where that value goes. It's important to have a unique identifier because, for
                example, using the title as an identifier will be redundant and cause issues within the database. The 
                releaseRYMIdentifier can be found in the top right (next to the title) on a release's page. Here's an
                example of what one looks like: [Album726652].

                RateYourMusic has a viety of release types, including: albums, EPs, singles, mixtapes, DJ mixes,
                compilations, videos, bootlegs, collaborations, and splits. The type of release can vastly change
                how the rest of the metadata looks, and while certain types can be inferred from that, it helps the
                overall readability. There are also certain releases that look like one release and are in-fact 
                another. For example, an EP that has 4 20-minute long songs would be assumed to be a full-length.
                album. It's also important for this value to repeat because, for example, something can be both an 
                EP and split.

                since this schema only covers one release (and one issue of that release), it's important to use the
                title it had at that specific release. For example, some re-issues may have a different title than
                the original issue. If your file is based off the first issue of the release, it should also hold
                that title. This is also the reason why releaseTitle cannot be repeated.

                the specific issue that this release is. It's also important to not use a conventional date 
                convention, like Library of Congress, because RateYourMusic has a different convention, which follows
                the format: [number for day] [full month spelled out] full number for year], e.g., 1 November 2011.

            <xsi:documentation>releaseGenres is a container that holds both releasePrimaryGenres and 
                releaseSecondaryGenres. The direct difference between primary and secondary genres are that primary
                genres are what you'd describe the release as and secondary genres are genres that typically describe
                certain influences on the album or smaller portions of the album. For example, if an album is 75% pop, 
                but 25% noise (percentages merely determined by length-time), then it would have a pop primary and a
                noise secondary. However, if an album is mostly pop but has noise undertones throughout, it would also
                be pop primary and noise secondary. Needless to say, all genres used must be from RateYourMusic. Here
                is a link to all of RateYourMusic's genres: https://rateyourmusic.com/rgenre/

                their execution is a lot more simple. Desriptors describe the sound while not attributing any genre to it.
                Descriptors are a relatively new feature and RateYourMusic and as a result don't have unique identifiers or
                descriptions. Only one description should be used in this element, however it is repeatable. Some examples
                of descriptors are: surreal, noisy, menacing, and playful.

                there is no hierachy system (like primary and secondary genres) and all languages spoken on the album should be
                included here. Like everything else, it's important to use the RateYourMusic convention and spell out the word instead
                of using abbreviatinos, like in Library of Congress.

                being the second track on the B side) or sometimes typically experimental artists using symbols to denote which track is

                string will also accept as valid. This is mandatory because the track position is automatically generated, even if not
                input, so if there is track information (which there always isn't), then this will be a value.
